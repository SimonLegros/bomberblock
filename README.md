# BomberBlock

## Projet Synthese de fin de DEC en informatique

Mon Projet consiste en un jeu multijoueur en temps rÃ©el pour le web. Il est de style "MMORPG" (massively multiplayer online role playing game).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

To clone the repo localy, run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SimonLegros/bomberblock.git
```

After cloning to entire project, you will have to install all dependencies

```sh
    npm install

    #If there is a problem with installing some dependencies, run the following
    npm audit fix
```

Then, run the following line

```sh
    npm run start
```

and you are now ready to access http://localhost:8080 to play!

### Prerequisites

To make my game run, you will need to install :

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - The Javascript run-time environment on the server-side

- [SQLite3]() - The SGBD used to keep all data of games
  Install with NPM:
  > npm install sqlite3

### Installation

All you need is to clone the repository, start the server with the command "node server.js" and finally access "localhost:8080" on any browser. The game will be up and running!
Google Chrome is preferable for this project mainly because of its V8 engine that makes Javascript much faster to execute!
